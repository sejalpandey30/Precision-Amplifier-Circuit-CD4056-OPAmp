### 🧠 How the Precision Amplifier Circuit Works – Step by Step

---

#### 🔋 1. **Powering the Circuit**

* You connect a **+5V and -5V power supply** to the CON1 connector.
* This gives energy to the whole circuit so it can start working.

---

#### 🌡️ 2. **Sensor Sends a Signal**

* A sensor like **LM35** gives a **small voltage** signal (for example, 0.25V if temperature is 25°C).
* This tiny signal goes into **CON2**, the input terminal.

---

#### ⚡ 3. **First Amplifier Boosts the Signal**

* The first op-amp (U1 - OP07) gets the small sensor signal.
* It **boosts (amplifies)** it slightly and also **protects** it from noise or sudden spikes.

---

#### 🔘 4. **You Choose Gain (Strength)**

* You use **switches (SW1, SW2)** to choose how much you want to amplify the signal.
* Each switch setting uses a different resistor (R3 to R6) to decide the **gain level** (like 1x, 10x, etc.).

---

#### 🔀 5. **Multiplexer (U3 - CD4052) Chooses One Signal**

* The multiplexer works like a **smart selector**.
* It picks the signal that matches the switch setting and sends it to the next op-amp.

---

#### 💪 6. **Second and Third Amplifiers Make Signal Strong**

* The next two op-amps (U4 and U5 - OP07) give more power to the signal and **keep it steady**.
* These make sure your output is **clear, accurate, and strong**.

---

#### 🔎 7. **You Get the Final Output**

* The amplified signal comes out at **CON3 or CON4**.
* You can check it with a **multimeter** or send it to a **display**.

---

### ✅ Summary (Super Simple)

* Power on the circuit.
* Send a small signal from a sensor.
* First amplifier boosts it a little.
* You choose how much more to boost it.
* Multiplexer selects the boosted signal.
* Final amplifiers clean and strengthen it.
* You get a nice, readable output.
